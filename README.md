# Dotfiles
A repository to store my current dotfile configuration.

# Stow
I use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage these configurations.

```
[michael@pc:~/Dotfiles]$
stow Config/
```
# Gentoo
The Gentoo folder has suckless builds and my kernel `.config` which I use on my computers.
